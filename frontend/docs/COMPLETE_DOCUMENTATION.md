### Data Models

#### Entry Structure
```javascript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  date: '2024-01-20T10:30:00Z',
  type: 'water|electricity|travel|waste|recycle',
  value: 150,
  unit: 'L|kWh|km|kg',
  meta: { mode: 'walk|bike|bus|car' }, // for travel
  notes: 'Optional user notes'
}
```

#### Badge Definition
```javascript
{
  id: 'water-saver',

  description: 'Use less than 100L for 7 days',
  icon: '💧',
  condition: 'function to check achievement',
  rarity: 'common|rare|epic|legendary'
}
```

### Calculation Algorithms

#### EarthScore Formula
```javascript
// Base score from 4 main categories (0-100 each)
const baseScore = 
  electricityScore * 0.3 +  // 30% weight
  waterScore * 0.25 +       // 25% weight
  travelScore * 0.25 +      // 25% weight
  wasteScore * 0.2;         // 20% weight

// Bonus points for eco-friendly behaviors
const bonus = 
  ecoTravelBonus +    // Up to 8 points
  recyclingBonus +    // Up to 5 points
  consistencyBonus;   // Up to 2 points

const finalScore = Math.min(100, baseScore + bonus);
```

#### Level Progression
- Level 1: 0 points (Eco Newcomer) 🌱
